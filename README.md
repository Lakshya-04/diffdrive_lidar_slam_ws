# Differential Drive Robot Simulation with Lidar

A **ROS 2 + Ignition Gazebo** simulation of a differential drive robot equipped with a **2D lidar sensor**, designed as a foundation for advanced robotics research and personal projects.  
This repository is structured for **easy expansion** — future versions will include **3D lidar simulation**, multiple robots, and various simulated environments.
